# Aqua-Sense
Our project aims to provide an efficient and cost-effective solution for monitoring water quality. Using an Arduino microcontroller and a turbidity sensor, our system measures the clarity of water in real-time. Turbidity is a crucial parameter in assessing water quality as it indicates the presence of suspended particles and impurities.
